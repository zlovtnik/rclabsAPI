## Deployment Steps

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Deployment (Low Risk)

#### [ ] 1.1 Binary Deployment

- [ ] Build new ETL Plus binary with refactored components
- [ ] Deploy binary to staging environment
- [ ] Verify binary starts successfully
- [ ] Check basic functionality (health endpoints, logging)
- [ ] Monitor resource usage for 1 hour

#### [ ] 1.2 Configuration Deployment

- [ ] Deploy new configuration files
- [ ] Verify configuration loading
- [ ] Test configuration validation
- [ ] Check backward compatibility with existing configs

#### [ ] 1.3 Feature Flag Deployment

- [ ] Deploy feature flags configuration
- [ ] Verify feature flag loading
- [ ] Confirm all features start in disabled state
- [ ] Test feature flag API endpoints

### Phase 2: Component Testing (Medium Risk)

#### [ ] 2.1 Logger System Testing

- [ ] Enable new logger system feature flag (25% rollout)
- [ ] Monitor log output for new format
- [ ] Verify log file rotation works
- [ ] Check log streaming functionality
- [ ] Monitor performance impact
- [ ] Rollback if issues detected

#### [ ] 2.2 Exception System Testing

- [ ] Enable new exception system feature flag (25% rollout)
- [ ] Test error handling with new exception types
- [ ] Verify error logging and correlation IDs
- [ ] Check exception serialization
- [ ] Monitor error rates
- [ ] Rollback if issues detected

#### [ ] 2.3 Request Handler Testing

- [ ] Enable new request handler feature flag (25% rollout)
- [ ] Test request processing with new components
- [ ] Verify validation and response building
- [ ] Check exception mapping functionality
- [ ] Monitor request throughput
- [ ] Rollback if issues detected

### Phase 3: Full Rollout (High Risk)

#### [ ] 3.1 Gradual Feature Enablement

- [ ] Increase logger system rollout to 50%
- [ ] Increase exception system rollout to 50%
- [ ] Increase request handler rollout to 50%
- [ ] Monitor system stability for 4 hours
- [ ] Check error rates and performance metrics

#### [ ] 3.2 WebSocket Manager Rollout

- [ ] Enable new WebSocket manager feature flag (25% rollout)
- [ ] Test WebSocket connections and messaging
- [ ] Verify connection pooling functionality
- [ ] Monitor WebSocket performance
- [ ] Increase rollout gradually to 100%

#### [ ] 3.3 Concurrency Patterns Rollout

- [ ] Enable new concurrency patterns (25% rollout)
- [ ] Monitor lock contention and performance
- [ ] Check for deadlocks or race conditions
- [ ] Verify thread safety of new components
- [ ] Increase rollout gradually to 100%

#### [ ] 3.4 Type System Rollout

- [ ] Enable new type system feature flag (25% rollout)
- [ ] Monitor for type-related errors
- [ ] Check performance impact of strong types
- [ ] Verify compatibility with existing APIs
- [ ] Increase rollout gradually to 100%

## Post-Deployment Validation

### [ ] 1. Functional Testing

- [ ] Test all ETL job types (create, monitor, cancel)
- [ ] Verify WebSocket real-time updates
- [ ] Test configuration hot-reloading
- [ ] Check log file management and rotation
- [ ] Validate error handling and reporting
- [ ] Test system under load

### [ ] 2. Performance Validation

- [ ] Compare response times with baseline
- [ ] Monitor memory usage patterns
- [ ] Check CPU utilization
- [ ] Validate database connection pooling
- [ ] Test concurrent user load
- [ ] Verify WebSocket throughput

### [ ] 3. Monitoring Validation

- [ ] Confirm monitoring script is running
- [ ] Verify alert system functionality
- [ ] Check monitoring dashboard data
- [ ] Validate log aggregation
- [ ] Test alert notifications

### [ ] 4. Documentation Update

- [ ] Update runbooks with new procedures
- [ ] Document new configuration options
- [ ] Update troubleshooting guides
- [ ] Create feature flag management procedures
- [ ] Document monitoring and alerting procedures

## Rollback Triggers and Procedures

### Critical Rollback Triggers

- [ ] System crashes or unavailability > 5 minutes
- [ ] Error rate increases > 200% from baseline
- [ ] Response time degradation > 50%
- [ ] Memory usage > 95% sustained
- [ ] Database connection failures > 10/minute

### Rollback Procedures

1. **Immediate Actions:**

   - Disable all new feature flags
   - Restart ETL Plus service
   - Monitor system recovery

2. **Full Rollback (if needed):**

   - Run `deployment/rollback.sh full`
   - Restore from backup if binary rollback insufficient
   - Verify system stability
   - Communicate rollback status to stakeholders

3. **Partial Rollback (preferred):**

   - Identify problematic component
   - Run `deployment/rollback.sh partial <component>`
   - Monitor system with reduced functionality
   - Plan targeted fix for problematic component
