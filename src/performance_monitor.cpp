// Implementation file for PerformanceMonitor class
// Most functionality is implemented in the header for performance reasons,
// but this file can contain any non-template implementations if needed in the future.

// Note: The current implementation is header-only for optimal performance
// in high-throughput scenarios. All methods are inlined for minimal overhead.
